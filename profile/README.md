Here are a set of python modules that extend Django to empower you to build an EDC / eSource system to handle data collection and management for multi-site longitudinal clinical trials. 

The codebase continues to evolve over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials through the [Harvard T Chan School of Public Health](https://aids.harvard.edu), the [Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership](https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp) in Gaborone, Botswana and the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://lshtm.ac.uk). Almost all trials have been related to HIV/AIDS research. Recent work with the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://lstm.ac.uk) has expanded into Diabetes (DM), Hypertension (HTN) and models of integrating care in Africa for the three main chronic conditions -- HIV/DM/HTN.

We have a number of active projects to review as example EDC systems built with these modules. The more recent the trial the better the example.
