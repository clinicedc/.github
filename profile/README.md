Here are a set of core modules to build an EDC / eSource system to handle data collection and management for multi-site longitudinal clinical trials. Refer to the specific open projects listed below for example EDC systems built with these modules. The more recent the trial the better the example.

The codebase continues to evolve over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials through the [Harvard T Chan School of Public Health](https://aids.harvard.edu), the [Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership](https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp) in Gaborone, Botswana and the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://lshtm.ac.uk). Almost all trials have been related to HIV/AIDS research. Recent work with the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://lstm.ac.uk) has expanded into Diabetes (DM), Hypertension (HTN) and models of integrating care in Africa for the three main chronic conditions -- HIV/DM/HTN.
