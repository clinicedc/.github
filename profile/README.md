Here are a set of python modules that extend Django to empower you to build an EDC / eSource system to handle data collection and management for multi-site (randomized) longitudinal clinical trials. 

The codebase continues to evolve over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials through the [Harvard T Chan School of Public Health](https://aids.harvard.edu), the [Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership](https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp) in Gaborone, Botswana, the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://lshtm.ac.uk) and the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://lstm.ac.uk). Almost all trials have been related to HIV/AIDS research. Recent work with the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://lstm.ac.uk) expands our work into Diabetes (DM), Hypertension (HTN) and models of integrating diabetes and hypertension care with HIV care in Africa.

We have a number of active clinical trials that use these modules for research data collection, monitoring, reporting and audit. All source code is published on GitHub. The more recent the trial the better the example. The [META Trial](https://github.com/meta-trial/meta-edc) has a [demo](https://github.com/meta-trial/meta3-sample) that you can build and run on your local machine.
